This number should be recalculated each week until the crop is mature. Use Figures 2 and 3 to determine the average rainfall per week in August and in September for central Buffalo County. The chart shows that, on average, central Buffalo County gets 0.60 inch of rain per week in August and 0.55 inch per week in September. The crop is expected to continue growing for three weeks in August and two weeks in September. Remaining available water at maturity is 5.25 inches. The you subtract the average august rain for three weeks which is 1.80 inches. Then you subtract the average September rain for 2 weeks which is 1.10 inches. This gives us that the water we need after accounting for average rain is 2.35 inches. The chart predicts that if average rainfall is received over the next five weeks, only 2.35 inches of irrigation would be needed to mature the crop.\n\n\n\n\n\n",

Seventy-five percent of these wells are domestic, although in places the aquifer is capable of supplying a sufficient volume of water for irrigation and commercial use. The biggest limitation to using the Dakota aquifer is potentially high salt concentrations.  Geologists think the salty water probably moves into the Dakota aquifer from underlying rocks, a hydraulic condition that is increased by heavy pumping.\n\n",

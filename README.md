## Abstract
This study addresses the limited application of large language models (LLMs) in the Agricultural Extension (AE) domain due to challenges with unstructured data and the limitations of general LLMs in handling domain-specific tasks. We introduced a new QA benchmark dataset, AgXQA, and further fine-tuned an encoder-LM, AgRoBERTa, which outperformed mainstream models in extractive QA tasks. AgRoBERTa achieved notable scores (EM: 55.15%, F1: 78.89%) and was validated with a custom human evaluation metric, showing a high agreement with expert assessments. The study underscores the potential of specialized LLMs to enhance agricultural practices through improved domain-specific NLP capabilities.

## Dependencies

The Python packages can be installed in a conda environment:
```
conda env create -f environment.yaml
